II. Installation Instructions
-----------------------------
To compile kmer-ssr, simply type `make'. The program will be in the `bin'
directory. You must support Python 3.5.1+.

To compile and install, type `make' followed by `make install'.  The binary
will be in both the `bin' and `/usr/local/bin' directories (to change this,
change the `PREFIX' variable in `Makefile').  

To uninstall, type `make clean' and if installed with `make install', also type
`make uninstall'.

See `INSTALL' for further instructions, especially about the `PYTHON3_BINARY'
variable.
